            Blog Post #5 - Wrapping Up "Butterfly"
          </p>
          <hr/>
          <p className="pt-6 text-2xl lora-font">
          As I reach the end of my capstone journey, I‚Äôve spent the final weeks polishing, testing, and preparing the Butterfly app for distribution. This phase primarily focused on refining the user experience through the app's final packaging, creating branding elements, and capturing its visual identity through hero shots.
          </p>
          <p className="pt-6 text-2xl lora-font">Context:
          </p>
          <p className="py-6"> This phase marked the culmination of months of work. The goal was to finalize and package the app so that it could run seamlessly on both Mac and Windows platforms. Alongside technical aspects, I also focused on branding by designing the final logo and app icon, ensuring they captured Butterfly's essence of calm, productivity, and accessibility. High-quality screenshots, known as hero shots, were another priority, as they serve as a key visual representation of the app‚Äôs functionality and interface.</p>
          
          <p className="pt-6 text-2xl lora-font">Action:</p>

          <p className="py-6">

          First, I turned my attention to the packaging process, ensuring that Butterfly could be run as a standalone app. Using Electron, I finalized the app builds for Mac and Windows, testing for any platform-specific issues. Debugging minor glitches, such as UI responsiveness and ensuring smooth AI task creation, was crucial during this phase. <br/> <br/>
          Next came the visual branding‚Äîan area I wanted to polish with a professional touch. After refining the logo multiple times throughout the project, I settled on a design that represents simplicity and lightness, reflecting the app‚Äôs purpose of helping ADHD professionals "fly" through their tasks. The app icon followed a similar design principle, ensuring it was recognizable yet minimal. <br/> <br/>
          Finally, I took several hero shots. This involved carefully capturing the key screens in high resolution, aiming to show the app‚Äôs accessible interface, clean design, and easy-to-use features. The shots were carefully selected to highlight the task management system, calendar integration, and AI features‚Äîall core elements of Butterfly.

          </p>
          <p className="pt-6 text-2xl lora-font">Result:</p>

          <p className="py-6">
          Through this process, I successfully built, tested, and packaged the app for both platforms. The logo and app icon now align with Butterfly‚Äôs brand identity, offering a professional yet approachable visual representation. The hero shots visually communicate the essence of the app, showcasing the clean, user-friendly design that I‚Äôve spent so much time refining.

          </p>

          <p className="pt-6 text-2xl lora-font">Learning:</p>

          <p className="py-6">
          One of the most significant lessons from this phase was the importance of attention to detail when finalizing a product. From app packaging to visual branding, every small decision influences how users experience the app. I also learned that creating visual assets, such as hero shots, requires thoughtful planning to effectively convey the app‚Äôs core features in a clear and appealing way.
